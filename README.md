# Stanford-Dogs-YOLO
**Stanford Dogs Dataset in YOLO Format**

The Stanford-Dogs-YOLO project provides the Stanford Dogs Dataset converted into YOLO format, facilitating its use in object detection models. This project aims to bridge the gap between academic datasets and practical application by providing a ready-to-use format for machine learning practitioners and researchers.

## Project Structure

- `PASCAL_VOC/`: Original dataset in PASCAL VOC format.
- `YOLO/`: Converted dataset in YOLO format.
- `classes.txt`: List of dog breed classes.
- `classes.txt`

## Usage

To use the dataset in YOLO format for training object detection models, follow the instructions specific to your model training framework. The `YOLO/` directory contains the dataset split into training, validation, and test subsets, with annotations in YOLO format.

## Conversion Script

A Python script for converting from PASCAL VOC format to YOLO format is included in the project. This script allows for easy conversion of other datasets or additional data in PASCAL VOC format.
